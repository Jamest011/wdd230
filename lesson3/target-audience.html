            <h3>Jackie Buckly</h3>
            <img class="audience" src="images/business_mother.jpg" alt="picture of young pregnant business women"> <!-- 480x320-->
            <p>Jackie is a 35 year old mother of 5 who runs a small school and is looking to move 
                into a bigger location. She is wanting to learn more about the area and 
                to connect with other businesses in the area to promote other stores to shop at for 
                school supplies and other school related needs. She also wants the new location 
                to be close to other businesses that have shoppers with kids.
                </p>
            <h3>Theodore Barker</h3>
            <img class="audience" src="images/business_man.jpg" alt="picture of older business gentleman"> <!-- 480x320-->
            <p>Theodore is has been in the printing business for more than 25 years. With online shopping 
                on the rise, he is needing to move into a bigger unit that has less of an office and more 
                garage and workshop space. This flex unit would be best away from traffic, but close enough 
                to other businesses that he has been working with over the years. He is seeking out help to 
                see where his suppliers are specifically located and how he can be closer to them while getting 
                a larger space.
